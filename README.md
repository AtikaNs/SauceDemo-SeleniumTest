# SauceDemo-SeleniumTest
Hi! This is my second automation repository. This is a web automation test for a dummy website named saucedemo.com. For this automation project, I'm using Selenium Java.

**Test Case Documentation** refer to **[this site](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nrlei4MNn5Em6Z227GIF7uA21DPb0q-v2_jy6sMb7GA/edit?usp=sharing)**.

**To run this repository**
1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/AtikaNs/SauceDemo-SeleniumTest.git
```

2. Open this directory to open each Selenium Java file
```
..\SeleniumTest-SauceDemo\demo\src\test\java
```

3. You can use three different methods:
- Click run icon near class name to run the whole class
**or**
- click run icon near each test script to run each test case
 **or**
- import each file to selenium extension.

 Feel free to reach me if you have any questions or want some collaboration, thank you!
